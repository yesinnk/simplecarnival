--------GAME DESCRIPTIONS----------

________Catch A Shape_____________

A game where the user controls a cup and aims to catch coins that fall down from the screen by moving the cup from side to side. 
The coin speed gradually increases throughout time to increase game difficulty. 
If the player misses enough coins, they will lose and the game will reset.
The object of the game is to collect enough coins.


________Cup Shuffler_______________
The classic cup shuffling game where the ball starts in the middle and is randomly shuffled for a certain number of times. 
If user guesses it right, the level increases which means the number of shuffles also increases. 
This makes it harder for the user to follow the cup. 
Every time they get it right, the number of coins they get is the same as the level they’re on. 
If they guess it wrong, the game resets and the cups are brought up to reveal the ball’s position. 
They can then play again by pressing start.  

_________Slide Game________________
A game where a user has to complete a level as fast as they can while collecting coins. 
The game takes places with a character sliding down a vine. The character must avoid enemies and collect coins

_________Petting Zoo_______________
A petting zoo where the goal of the game is to pet the pig as many times as possible within a short amount of time. Don't make the pig angry!

--------AUTHORS' NOTES-------------

1. In Phase 2, our group put a lot more emphasis on documenting our code and making sure our classes
   had clear descriptions of their purpose. 

2. Another new main feature added to Simple Carnival is another game called Slide Game. See description above

3. The UML diagrams for all the games are located within the phase2 directory of our app.
